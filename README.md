# Restaurant Website

This is a mock restaurant website project, created to showcase the menu, location, and the admmin section of a local restaurant. 
Because this was a school project that had to be done in a limited time (4 weeks), the responsive side of the website wasn't a priority, and most of the content is fake.

## Project Description

The website is mostly a one pager, with a 'Contact page', and a admin section. I had to create a mockup design that was changed and approved by my client. 
Then I started by the backend of the project which took most of the time.
After that came the integration of Javascript, and CSS. 
The hardest part for me then, was all the structure of my menu, all necessary queries to get my data, and the changes that had to be done because of the limited time.

## Frontend
The frontend was splited in a couple different CSS files to have more structure. 
- The 'Main Page' style
- The 'Contact page' style
- The 'Admin' style

## Backend
For the backend, PHP was used with a MVC framework, and also a SQL database for the content.
